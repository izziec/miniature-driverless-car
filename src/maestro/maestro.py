"""Module for controlling a Polulu Micro Maestro 6-Channel USB Server Controller.

This module communciates with the controller using the compact protocol. This
means that there must be exactly one controller connected via USB.

The controller should be configured to be in USB_DUAL_PORT mode so that two way
communication can happen over a single serial port.

Serial command reference can be found at https://www.pololu.com/docs/0J40/5.e
